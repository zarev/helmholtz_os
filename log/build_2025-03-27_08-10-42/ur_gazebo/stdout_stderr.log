  By not providing "Findcontroller_manager.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this

  "controller_manager", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "controller_manager" with any of the following names:

    controller_managerConfig.cmake
    controller_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "controller_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "controller_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "controller_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
