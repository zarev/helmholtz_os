      "### Q1: How do rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries compare to traditional lithium-ion batteries in terms of theoretical energy density, and why is this significant?  \n",
      "**A1:** Rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries have a much higher theoretical energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. This is significant because it means they could potentially store more energy per unit volume or weight, making them highly attractive for applications requiring high-energy storage solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q2: What role does CO2 play in the operation of Li/Na−CO2 batteries, and why is this considered environmentally friendly?  \n",
      "**A2:** In Li/Na−CO2 batteries, CO2 acts as both an oxidizer in the battery reaction and a component that can be fixed, reducing its release into the atmosphere. This dual role makes these batteries environmentally friendly because they contribute to CO2 fixation while operating.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q3: Why is overvoltage rising considered a critical issue for the performance of Li/Na−CO2 batteries?  \n",
      "**A3:** Overvoltage rising indicates an increase in the energy required to drive the electrochemical reactions in the battery, leading to inefficiencies and reduced performance. This is a critical issue because it directly impacts the practicality and efficiency of these batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q4: What specific mechanisms contribute to the formation of a porous interphase layer between the separator and Li/Na anode during overvoltage rising?  \n",
      "**A4:** The formation of a porous interphase layer is attributed to the gradual degradation and mechanical failure of battery components under high stress. This includes the interaction between the anode material, separator, and CO2 environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q5: How do control experiments help in identifying the underlying mechanisms dictating the morphological evolution of Li/Na anodes?  \n",
      "**A5:** Control experiments allow researchers to isolate specific variables and observe their effects on the battery's performance. By systematically changing one parameter at a time, such as CO2 concentration or electrode materials, they can determine how these factors influence the degradation processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q6: What is the significance of studying the failure mechanisms in rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries?  \n",

This knowledge is essential for developing strategies to mitigate these issues and improve the overall efficiency and practicality of these batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q7: How does the interaction between CO2 and other components influence the electrochemical behavior of Li/Na−CO2 batteries?  \n",
      "**A7:** The interaction with CO2 can alter the anode surface, affecting its ability to undergo stable reactions. Additionally, it influences the formation of reaction products, which can either enhance or degrade battery performance depending on specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q8: What are the potential implications of achieving better electrochemical performances in rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries?  \n",
      "**A8:** Improved performance could lead to more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly power storage solutions. This would have significant applications in areas such as renewable energy integration, electric vehicles, and portable electronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q9: Why is the combinatorial use of nondestructive and postmortem characterization tools advantageous for studying these batteries?  \n",
      "**A9:** Nondestructive methods allow in-depth analysis without damaging the battery components, enabling multiple tests and comprehensive data collection. Postmortem analysis provides detailed insights into how the battery degrades over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q10: What challenges remain in advancing rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries for practical applications?  \n",
      "**A10:** Key challenges include optimizing energy efficiency, improving cycle stability, addressing decomposition issues of battery components, and developing scalable manufacturing processes. Tackling these can pave the way for widespread use of these advanced battery systems.\n",

It reveals that the detachment and isolation of NCM particles cause the current focusing on the remaining active regions of cathode. The extent of Li stripping and the likelihood of Li+ plating into LPSCl facing the active NCM particles becomes higher. Besides, the homogeneity of Li stripping/plating is improved by homogenizing the electrochemical reactions at the cathode side by LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) coating. These results suggest a codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode that is mediated by uneven Li ion flux. This work contributes to a holistic understanding of the degradation mechanisms in ASSLMBs and opens new opportunities for their further optimization and development.\n",

      "All solid-state lithium metal battery (ASSLMB) technology, which features improved safety property and higher energy density compared with the state-of-the-art lithium ion battery (LIB) technology, is being pursued worldwide for next-generation energy storage [\\[1–4\\].](#page-11-0) The improved safety characteristic is guaranteed by using the intrinsically nonflammable solid-state electrolytes (SEs) that are expected to fundamentally avoid the safety hazards of the thermally unstable liquid-state electrolyte counterparts. The higher energy density is enabled by employing the highspecific-capacity Li layered oxide cathode materials as well as Li metal anode materials [\\[5,6\\]](#page-11-0). Nevertheless, hitherto reported laboratory ASSLMB prototypes exhibit unsatisfied fast performance decay that challenges their practical application [\\[7–10\\].](#page-11-0) Therefore, revealing the fundamental science towards the degradation problems and gaining an in-depth understanding of the underlying\n",

At the cathode side, Janek's group [\\[11\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally demonstrated the significant volume change of active materials (AMs) during de/lithiation and Wang's group [\\[5\\]](#page-11-0) further showed that this volume changeinduced irreversible structural breakdown of secondary polycrystalline AM particles in form of large cracks could increase the local ion transport barrier, leading to fast capacity decay of ASSLMBs. At the anode side, Janek's group [\\[12\\]](#page-11-0) discussed the physicochemical concepts that lead to the uncontrollable Li electrodeposits and they summarized two mechanistic origins for their penetration through SEs, i.e., current focusing at the interface and the partial electronic conductivity of SEs. Besides, McDowell's group [\\[13\\]](#page-11-0) confirmed that the unwanted Li/SE side reactions are current-dependent in nature and the generated by-products determine dominantly the interfacial chemo-mechanical failures. Apart from the cathode and anode materials, SEs also play an unneglectable role in ASSLMB failures. It has been previously reported that the intrinsic properties of SEs\n",

These studies have greatly enriched the knowledge of ASSLMB degradation mechanisms at the cathode, anode and SE sides from the aspects of chemistry, electrochemistry, and mechanology. However, considering that most of the abovementioned studies employ half-cell configurations and focus primarily on single electrode component, uncertainties would arise when applying these conclusions during full-cell batteries optimization. Additionally, although each battery component contributes to the detected performance decay, it is very likely that they play varying roles during the operation and it is still unclear whether one or combination of them dominates. Moreover, taking into account that the battery performance decays inconsistently during different stages of operation, it appears that the failure mechanism may evolve constantly during battery cycling and an interdependent interaction among the abovementioned failure mechanisms may exist. Therefore, developing a holistic mechanistic understanding of these failure behaviors contributed from cathode, anode, and SEs is indispensable in drawing a complete picture describing the comprehensive degradation mechanisms of ASSLMBs. Unfortunately, this comprehensive and elaborate understanding remains unestablished due to the lack of proper characterization techniques.\n",

      "Synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (SXCT) seems to be one of the most suitable characterization techniques due to its versatile benefits, including non-destructive and three-dimensional nature, multi-scale spatial resolution, and high temporal resolution [\\[18,19\\].](#page-11-0) Its underlying principle is based on the physics of interaction of X-rays with matter, which can be described using the Beer-Lambert's law [\\[20\\].](#page-11-0) The attenuation degree of the transmitted Xrays, which is manifested as different greyscale values in tomographic images, is proportionally correlated with the electron density of the constituent atoms [\\[21\\].](#page-11-0) Hence, different battery components among AMs, SEs, and Li can be distinguished by analyzing grey values of the obtained absorption-contrast images. Using this technique, Sun's group [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0) visualized the microstructural evolution of AM particles in solid-state batteries and disclosed the origin of low reversible capacity caused by the poor physical contact during their heterogeneous phase conversion. In addition, McDowell's group [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0) found that it is the extent of the mechanical fracture in the SE other than the electrochemically formed interphase layer that causes the impedance increase. Recently, both Shearing's group [\\[24\\]](#page-11-0) and Bruce's group [\\[25\\]](#page-11-0) have three-dimensionally tracked the propagation of SE cracks and the ensuing infiltration of Li electrodeposits therein in Li symmetrical cells. Our group [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) has also visually and three-dimensionally recorded the irreversible Li creep, the evolved Li/SE interface, as well as the plastic deformation and mechanical fracture of SE after battery cycling, revealing the complicated electro-chemomechanical coupling in Li symmetrical cells. These applications of SXCT in solid-state battery research provide unparalleled opportunities in exploring the microstructure evolution of the battery components during battery operation and shed unprecedent insights into the fundamental degradation mechanisms determining battery failure. However, report using this technique to establish a holistic mechanistic understanding of the sophisticated and elusive failure mechanisms in full-cell type ASSLMBs is still missing.\n",

      "Herein, we chose LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM)|Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl)|Li ASSLMB as a model cell and SXCT as the main probing tool to investigate the underpinning performance deterioration mechanisms of ASSLMBs. A comparison of the SXCT results between the uncycled and decayed ASSLMBs clearly points to a codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode material that is mediated by uneven Li ion flux. To be more specific, the SXCT results suggest that the gradually accumulated volumetric expansion/contraction of NCM particles could cause detachment and isolation from the cathode matrix, leading to partial deactivation of cathode and localized current density on the remaining active region. Consequently, both the extent of Li stripping and the probability of Li+ ion reduction at the SE intergranular boundaries facing the remained active NCM particles become higher, leading to further loss of active cathode and anode materials as well as an exacerbated capacity decay. Further electrochemical tests and SXCT results clearly show that by homogenizing the electrochemical reactions at the cathode side via LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) coating (LZP-NCM), both the homogeneity of Li stripping/plating at the anode side and the capacity retention of the ASSLMBs are improved. This fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results from the NCM and LZP-NCM based batteries validates the codependent failure correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li ion flux. Moreover, postmortem experimental findings provide further evidence that a heterogeneous electrochemical reaction at the cathode side could cause an increased local current density to exacerbate unwanted side-reactions at the anode side. In the last, finite element analysis provides direct insights of the heterogeneous potential distribution and current focusing between cathode and anode in the decayed ASSLMBs. Our work emphasizes the previously underestimated interdependence between cathode and anode in governing ASSLMB failures and the discovered codependent failure mechanism contributes significantly to a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanisms in ASSLMBs.\n",

      "The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM) was provided by Fengyuan Chemical Co. Ltd. The LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) buffer layer coating NCM, abbreviated as LZP-NCM, was prepared and studied as control samples. The LZP coating onto NCM was achieved via a facile sol–gel method. During the LZP buffer layer coating, a corresponding mole ratio of LiH2PO4 and Zr(NO3)45H2O was mixed in ethanol solution for 2 h to prepare the LZP sol precursor. After that, NCM powders were added into the LZP sol precursor at 80 C and they were mixed under slow agitation for 6 h for coating. In the current study, the 1 wt% LZP coating was chosen, and the mass ratio of the NCM cathode material and the LZP coating material is 1:0.01. The coating process was finished when the ethanol was completely volatilized. In the last, the obtained product was sintered at 750 C under oxygen atmosphere for 1 h to obtain the final LZP coated NCM811, i.e., the LZP-NCM.\n",

After that, the ball-milled powder was pressed into a pellet that was sintered at 550 C under Argon atmosphere for 8 h. The obtained Li6PS5Cl pellet was sufficiently ground before using for cell assembly and its ionic conductivity was about 3.0 103 S/cm at 25 C.\n",

      "The (LZP-)NCM|LPSCl|Li (abbreviated as (LZP-)NCM|Li) ASSLMBs using the swage-cell design were built using a PAEK solid-statebattery mold (Hefei Kejing Mater. Tech. Co. Ltd.). The cathode was a mixture of (LZP-)NCM, LPSCl electrolyte, and super C65 conductive agent at 70:30:3 weight ratio. The steps for the allsolid-state battery assembly are as follows: firstly, 120 mg LPSCl solid-state electrolyte powder was added to the battery mold, which was then pressed into a solid pellet at 150 MPa pressure for 2 min. Secondly, 10 mg composite cathode powder was evenly tiled on one side of the solid-state electrolyte pellet under 370 MPa for 2 min. Thirdly, a lithium foil (d = 8 mm) with a thickness of 0.3 mm was placed on the other side of the solid-state electrolyte pellet at 150 MPa for 1 min. The thicknesses of LPSCl SE and composite cathode pellets were respectively 550 and 250 lm. During electrochemical testing, a constant pressure was applied on the assembled solid-state-battery via a special stainless steel clamp to ensure close contact among battery components. All batteries assembled with either NCM or LZP-NCM were cycled using Land battery test system (Land CT2001A, Wuhan Land Electronic Co., Ltd.) at 0.5 C (1 C = 200 mA/g) between 2.6 and 4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+ ) until battery failure.

      "During the assembly of tomo-cells, the punched Li (3 mm in diameter) was placed on top of the stainless steel (SS) pin (3 mm in diameter) and then they were both loaded in a polyimide tube (3 mm in diameter). Then, 50 mg LPSCl electrolyte powder was added in the polyimide tube (with a diameter of 3 mm). The 4 mg cathode composite powder was evenly tiled on top of the solid-state electrolyte layer, followed by the Al sheet (with a diameter of 3 mm) as a current collector. Note that the cathode composite for building tomo-cells is the same as that for building swage-cells. Afterwards, 100 MPa pressure was applied to them for 1 min to form a pellet. After releasing the pressure, the obtained pellet was sandwiched by two stainless-steel screws during cell assembly. All tomo-cells were properly sealed off before taking out of the glovebox. Tomo-cells assembled with NCM and LZP-NCM were cycled at 0.1 C between 2.6 and 4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+ ) for 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. All cells were cycled at 30 C without applying additional constant pressure. The torque that was used to fasten both the top and bottom bolts was 2 N m (measured by a digital torque wrench) and no further external pressure was used during battery operation. The electrochemical results of tomo-(swage-)cells show that the swage-cells are more prone to undergo short circuit than the tomo-cells, which is probably due to the grown lithium dendrite that can puncture easily the thin SE electrolyte in the swage-cells.\n",

      "Part of the synchrotron X-ray tomography measurements were conducted at P05 beamline at DESY (Hamburg, Germany). For the measurements conducted here, the synchrotron beam energy was monochromatized to 25 keV using a double crystal monochromator (DCM). A CdWO4 single crystal scintillator of 100 lm thickness was used to convert the X-ray to visible light. A fast KIT CMOS camera (5120 pixel 3840 pixel) that was kept out of the direct beam using a mirror was used. The 2400 projections within a 180 battery rotation were recorded with exposure times of 25 ms per projection. The field of view (FoV) is 3.28 mm 2.46 mm, with a pixel size of 0.65 lm. Note that a binning process of 2 by 2 was used when reconstructing the dataset to get a high signal to noise ratio, yielding a final pixel size of 1.3 lm. The tomography data from P05 beamline were reconstructed at the beamline using the Matlab program based on the ASTRA Toolbox [\\[29\\]](#page-11-0). To improve the data consistency of the grey values calculated from the selected regions of interests (ROIs) from different regions, the analysis of the greyscale values of the reconstructed volumes of the cycled tomo-cells was normalized using the greyscale values belonging to the LPSCl electrolyte.\n",

      "Besides the SXCT measurements conducted at the P05 beamline, an uncycled tomo-cell was also measured at the BL13HB beamline (the previous BL13W1 beamline) at SSRF (Shanghai, China). For the measurement conducted at SSRF, the synchrotron beam energy was monochromatized via a double crystal monochromator to 20 keV. The detector system comprised a 50 lm thick Yag:Ce scintillator and four kinds of X-ray critical current density (CCD) detectors of different spatial resolutions from 0:19 lm/pixel to 24 lm/pixel. During the measurement, 2000 projections within a 180 battery rotation were recorded with the exposure time of 80 ms. The FoV is 3.328 mm 3.328 mm. The resultant spatial resolution is 1.625 lm. The sample-to-detector distance was 40 mm. Under this measuring condition, the inline phase-contrast effect could occur to some extent and the samples were measured under mixed absorption- and phase-contrast mode. The reconstructed data are shown in Fig. S1 (online), which are in good agreement with the results obtained at the P05 beamline.

      "Finite element method was conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in ASSLMBs. The model of the simulation battery is shown in Fig. S12 (online). It is consisted of a ''sandwich\" structure containing rectangular Li anode (upper grey part), SE electrolyte (middle part), and the cathode (five rows of circular cathode particles (10 lm in diameter) dispersed evenly in SE electrolyte at the bottom). The dimension of the simulation battery is 420 lm 250 lm (length width). The thickness of the solid-state electrolyte is 100 lm. To save the simulation cost and focus on the codependent behavior between cathode and anode, the polycrystalline structure of NCM particles and the stress evolution in them during battery cycling are not considered. Two different scenarios regarding the Li anode were simulated. Firstly, the effect of cathode reaction heterogeneity on the uneven lithium deposition behavior was simulated using a flat Li anode mimicking the SXCT results of the uncycled cells. During the simulation of this scenario, the cathode particles located in the central part of the cathode are artificially set to be electrochemically inactive to study their effect on the Li deposition behavior at Li anode side (Fig. S12a online). The results of Li plating accumulation are shown in Fig. S13 (online). Secondly, the scenario in which the Li anode was modified with protruded elliptical Li deposits extending into the SE (Fig. S12b online), mimicking the SXCT results of the decayed NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, was simulated. During the simulation of this scenario, the cathode particles located at both sides were artificially set to be electrochemically inactive to simulate their physical contact failure during battery cycling. The simulation was conducted during battery charging at 100 A/m2 current density. The potential distribution, Li+ ion flux density distribution and von Mises stress distribution in the simulation battery were simulated. During both simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density of LPSCl-based electrolyte are 28 GPa, 0.27, and 1.8 g/cm3 , respectively. Only twodimensional (2D) FEA simulations were conducted in the current work. The parameters used in the simulation are listed in Table S1 (online).\n",

      "The as-studied ASSLMBs were built with polycrystalline NCM cathode active material, LPSCl solid electrolyte, and Li metal anode. In addition, NCM particles coated with the NASICON-based (fastion-conductor compound) LZP, which possesses simultaneously high electrochemical stability and mechanical strength [\\[27,28\\]](#page-11-0) were used as control samples (LZP-NCM) to suppress the interfacial reactions and the mechanical degradation issues facing the bare NCM (Figs. S2, S3 and Note S1 online). During the assembly and test of the batteries, two different types of cell designs were used, i.e., the commercially available swagelok cell (swage-cell) design and the self-made tomography cell (tomo-cell) design [(Fig. 1](#page-4-0)a). Batteries using both cell designs demonstrated consistent electrochemical performance and structural evolution and only the tomo-cells were used for SXCT. During the SXCT measurement [\\[29,30\\]](#page-11-0), the energy of the monochromatic X-rays was 25 keV and the FoV was 3.28 mm 2.46 mm. A spatial resolution of 1.3 lm was yielded after data binning to improve the signal-to-noise ratio [\\[31\\].](#page-11-0) Detailed material synthesis and characterization, battery assembly and test, finite element simulation and post-mortem measurement can be found in the Experimental section.\n",

      "[Fig. 1](#page-4-0) displays comparatively the electrochemical performance of the ASSLMBs using both cell designs assembled with bare NCM and LZP-NCM. [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)a shows the schematic illustration of the as-studied ASSLMBs using both swage-cell and tomo-cell designs. The cycling performance test of ASSLMBs using the swage-cell design, as shown in [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)b, shows that although both the studied cells (assembled with either NCM or LZP-NCM) decay during cycling, the capacity retention of the NCM|LPSCl|Li battery after 70 cycles (abbreviated as NCM|Li-70, 66.1%, red dot line) is lower than that of the LZP-NCM|LPSCl|Li cell after 90 cycles (abbreviated as LZP-NCM|Li-90, 79%, blue dot line). [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)c shows respectively the selected charge–discharge profiles of the NCM|Li-70 swage-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-90 swage-cell, displaying more severe decay of the former. These results suggest that the swagecell using bare NCM exhibits the lower capacity retention and faster capacity decay compared with the control cell using LZP-NCM, which is in good agreement with previous report [\\[27\\]](#page-11-0). In a similar way, the results shown in [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)d and e exhibit that a consistent electrochemical evolution to the swage-cells can be noted from the tomo-cells, that is, besides a continuous capacity decline, a lower capacity retention and faster capacity decay is observed in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell than the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. Note that the obtained lower capacities of the tomo-cells compared with the swage-cells are caused by the lack of an external auxiliary pressure (0 MPa for tomo-cells vs. 160 MPa for swagecells). Despite this difference, these results suggest that the tomo-cell design could be used reliably for studying the gradual degradation mechanisms of ASSLMBs. Hence, the tomo-cell design, which is compatible with the non-destructive SXCT technique, was used to reveal the fundamental science for the continuous capacity loss of the batteries built with bare NCM on one hand, and on the other hand unravel the underlying cause for the enhanced performance of the batteries built with LZP-NCM.\n",

The corresponding electrochemical performance results of the (LZP-)NCM| Li-50 cell are shown in Fig. S4 and Note S2 (online).

These digital greyscale images possessing distinct absorption contrast are correlated with the different Xray absorbing capabilities of the constituting atoms in the measured sample, with bright (dark) region corresponding to high(low) atomic number atom contained NCM (S or Li). The three panels in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a collectively exhibit a slight change at the Li/LPSCl interface in the NCM|Li-50 cell (pink dotted line in panel II) after intermediate capacity decay but a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell (pink dotted line in panel III) after severe capacity decay, compared with the NCM|Li-0 tomo-cell (pink dotted line in panel I). The panel III in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a further shows that besides the overall diminished thickness of Li anode, at some regions of the Li/LPSCl interface, the Li anode has completely ''disappeared\" and the electrolyte is found to reach almost the SS collector (yellow arrows in panel III). These three panels in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a also demonstrate a similar morphological change at the cathode side: a slight change in the NCM|Li-50 cell vs. a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell (blue dotted lines). The panel III in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a further shows that the NCM particles that are in close contact with the LPSCl electrolyte are somehow ''diluted\" by the LPSCl electrolyte after 100 cycles, as indicated by the ''drifted\" NCM particles (blue arrows in panel III). The significant changes of the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell are three-dimensionally shown and compared with the NCM|Li-0 cell, as shown in their 3D volume renderings [(Fig. 2](#page-5-0)b).

      "Further in-depth investigation of the microstructural changes in the decayed NCM|Li-100 cell comparing with the pristine NCM|Li-0 cell is conducted via analyzing their greyscale value changes. During the analysis of the greyscale values, several 2D ROIs (the interesting regions to be analyzed), which can capture reliably the characteristic changes of battery components (e.g., cathode and electrolyte), are carefully selected and analyzed. To begin with, four rectangular ROIs are selected from the four green dash rectangles (region i' to iv') in the control NCM|Li-0 cell (the first panel in [Fig. 2b](#page-5-0)) and they are enlarged as the in-set figures in Fig. S5a (online). A visual inspection of these enlarged figures demonstrates a homogenous distribution of NCM particles through the cathode. This is confirmed in Fig. S5b (online) by their consistent histograms of the distribution of grey values (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows to show more details), with one major peak around 22,100 arbitrary unit (a.u.) assigned to the LPSCl SE and one shoulder peak around 22,600 a.u. corresponding to the NCM particles. This homogeneous distribution of the NCM particles through the cathode is also proved by analyzing three depth-depended square ROIs selected from three horizontal panels at three different depths along the cathode, as shown in Fig. S5c and d (online). In contrast, the different scenario is captured in the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell (the second panel in [Fig. 2b](#page-5-0)), as clearly shown in the in-set figures of black rectangles in [Fig. 2c](#page-5-0): slightly brighter (higher X-ray absorbing) NCM particles are drifted above the slightly blurred (comparatively lower X-ray absorbing) NCM particles located near the Al current collector. Their histogram profiles of grey values (with log-scaled version superimposed in color shadows) shown in [Fig. 2d](#page-5-0) exhibit two different features compared with the control pristine sample: (1) the overall grey values corresponding to the NCM particles become higher than the original 22,600 a.u. (red dash line in the topmost panel), which exceed 23,000 a.u.; and (2) the NCM shoulder peak is significantly broadened and in some area like region C-3, the highest grey value corresponding to the strongest X-ray absorption reaches 25,000 a.u (red dash line in the panel C-3). Further analysis of another three rectangular ROIs selected from three different depth-dependent horizontal semicircular planes along the cathode, as shown in [Fig. 2f](#page-5-0)–h, yields similar findings. These results suggest that the drifted particles at the cathode/SE interface [(Fig. 2,](#page-5-0) g1) do possess higher grey value (25,000 a.u., light blue dash line in [Fig. 2h](#page-5-0)) than the particles located near the Al current collector ([Fig. 2,](#page-5-0) g3, dark blue dash line in [Fig. 2h](#page-5-0)).\n",

      "These unraveled microstructural changes of the cycled cathode can partially explain the capacity decay of the NCM|Li-100 cell. First of all, the currently observed drifted NCM particles in the SE should be generated from the push up by the remaining NCM particles via their significant volumetric expansion during battery cycling. Considering that these drifted NCM particles possess stronger X-ray absorbing capability (25,000 a.u.) than their pristine state (22,600 a.u.), it appears that they are at the delithiated state of low content of low X-ray absorbing Li. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that these drifted NCM particles are very likely electrochemically inactive and they are ionically or electronically isolated from the cathode matrix. As a matter of fact, Carter's group [\\[32\\]](#page-11-0) found that delamination of active material from the composite electrode can be triggered when the volumetric change of the electrode particles reaches about 7.5% during (de)intercalation, which is the case for the currently used NCM-811 that undergoes about 7% volume change during operation [\\[11\\].](#page-11-0) These deactivated NCM particles would result in the loss of battery capacity during cycling. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that although the blurred NCM particles near the Al collector appear to have decreased X-ray absorbing capability, grey value analysis suggests that they actually possess higher X-ray absorbing ability (c.a., 24,200 a.u.) than their pristine state (22,600 a.u.). This fact implies that most of the blurred NCM particles are also at the delithiated state of low content of low X-ray absorbing Li. The ''blurring\" of these NCM particles is most likely resulted from the formation of non-X-ray absorbing cracks, as shown below in the post-mortem SEM results. Collectively, these results show that the deactivation of the NCM particles and the loss of Li content in them are responsible for the capacity decay and the lost Li should be repositioned in other battery components such as the SE and anode (see more discussion below).\n",

      "At the anode side, looking at the overall diminished thickness of Li anode and the regions of disappeared Li as vividly shown in Fig. 2a, it is interesting to ask why the Li anode is diminished and the LPSCl electrolyte is seemingly swelled after long-term battery cycling. Aiming to study if the ''disappeared\" Li has ''migrated\" into the LPSCl SE and caused its swell during battery cycling, the greyscale histogram profiles of the selected four rectangular ROIs near anode side (regions E-1 to E-4 in black dash rectangles in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)c) are analyzed and shown in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0) (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows). This figure shows that, compared with the pristine sample (the topmost panel in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0)), the LPSCl peaks become broader with low grey values extending to 20,000 a.u. (black arrows in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0)). The extension of grey values of the cycled LPSCl SE (e.g., region E-2 to E-4 in [Fig. 2c](#page-5-0)) to lower numbers indicates that it is taking in of low X-ray absorbing materials such as generated Li electrodeposits or formed cracks. In order to further confirm and discern this indication, two rectangular ROIs that are selected respectively from two cross-sections of the intermediately decayed NCM|Li-50 cell and the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell are investigated, as shown in Fig. S6 (online). Fig. S6a1 (online) shows that the selected cross-section of the NCM|Li-50 cell and therefrom a rectangular ROI of a red box is cropped and enlarged in Fig. S6a2 (online). The plot profile of the greyscale value along the red arrow line in Fig. S6a2 (online) is shown in Fig. S6a3 (online), which shows clearly the existence and embracing of Li by the surrounding electrolyte. Moreover, from the cross-section and the selected ROI of the NCM|Li-100 cell, as shown respectively in Fig. S6b1 and b2 (online), one can observe notably that a long and narrow Li ''chip\", which looks like being squeezed into the space between neighboring LPSCl grains, is completely enclosed within the LPSCl SE. This is confirmed by the plot profile of the greyscale value along the red arrow line (Fig. S6b2 online), transecting the Li chip and the surrounding LPSCl SE, as shown in Fig. S6b3 (online). This isolated Li deposition within the intergranular boundaries has been theoretically explained from an electronic conductivity perspective and then experimentally confirmed [\\[33–35\\].](#page-11-0) Additionally, previous report from Pylypenko's group [\\[36\\]](#page-11-0) also attributed the gradually diminished thickness of Li anode as a function of battery cycling to its migration into the porous structures of the b-Li3PS4 (LPS) SE. The current finding of the Li deposition within specific SE regions can perfectly explain the loss of Li content at NCM cathode as well as the diminished Li bulk at Li anode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining the abovementioned results and discussions at cathode and anode sides, a clear and holistic view of the failure mechanisms of the solid-state batteries can be reliably obtained. During the former cycles, almost all NCM particles participate in electrochemical reactions due to the continuous, homogeneous and percolating ion and electron conduction network, guaranteed by the sufficient solid–solid contact shown in Fig. S7 (online). This homogenous electrochemical reaction at the cathode would result in an even and steady Li+ ion flux flowing into/from the Li anode, leading to a balanced and uniform Li plating/stripping. With continuous cycling, the gradually accumulated volumetric expansion/ contraction of cathode particles would take effect, pushing up the outlying particles into discretely drifted ones on one hand, and on the other hand isolating some particles from the cathode matrix. These two scenarios would both lead inevitably to capacity decay due to the deactivation of the NCM particles. The deactivation of NCM particles also implies that during subsequent cycling, the overall cell current that is either provided by or subjected to the cell would concentrate mostly on the remaining active NCM particles. This current focusing (or constriction) is twofold [\\[37\\]:](#page-11-0) one is the uneven Li+ ion flux that causes significant Li stripping from the part of Li anode facing the active NCM particles during battery discharging, the other one is the increased localized current density that drives the Li+ ion flux into the SE intergranular boundaries where they are preferentially reduced during battery charging. This hypothesis explains fundamentally the phenomena of the ''disappeared\" Li anode and the ''swelled\" LPSCl SE. This irreversible consumption of the anode Li would aggravate due to the further loss of active NCM particles, and in the end, the battery would completely fail due to the entire depletion of the accessible Li.\n",

      "[Fig. 3a](#page-7-0) shows sequentially the cross-sections of the reconstructed SXCT data of LZP-NMC|Li-0, LZP-NMC|Li-50, and LZP-NMC|Li-100 cells. These three panels collectively exhibit that, compared with the LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell, no appreciable changes at the Li/ LPSCl interface are observed in both the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-50 cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell (pink dotted lines) besides a homogeneously decreased thickness of Li anode (pink double-headed arrows). [Fig. 3b](#page-7-0) shows comparatively the 3D volume renderings of the LZP-NMC|Li-0 and LZP-NMC|Li-100 cells. In a similar way to the analysis of the aforementioned NCM|Li cell, an in-depth investigation of the microstructural changes in the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell comparing the pristine LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell is conducted via analyzing their greyscale value changes. Fig. S8a (online) shows the results of the selected cross-sections of the reference LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell and the four black rectangular ROIs containing cathode. These ROIs show a homogenous distribution of the LZP-NCM particles through the cathode, which is confirmed in Fig. S8b (online) by their consistent grey value histograms around 22,300 a.u. (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows). The homogeneous distribution of the LZP-NCM particles through the cathode is also proved by analyzing three depthdependent horizontal square ROIs along the cathode, as shown in Fig. S8c and d (online). It is worth noting that the X-ray absorption of LZP-NCM particles decreases slightly compared with NCM particles, due to either the wrapping of LZP containing light elements (e.g., Li and P) or the X-ray refraction at the interface. For the cathode cycled in the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell, [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0) shows the selected four cross-sectional panels (region i–iv in the right panel of [Fig. 3](#page-7-0)b) as well as the enlarged view of the four rectangular ROIs containing cathode (black rectangles in [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0)). A visual inspection of these ROIs shows that slightly brighter (higher X-ray absorbing) LZP-NCM particles are located uppermost while slightly blurred (comparatively lower X-ray absorbing) LZP-NCM particles are positioned at the bottom near the Al collector. This varied delithiation state of the cycled LZP-NCM particles is confirmed by their histogram profiles of grey values (with log-scaled version superimposed in color shadows) shown in [Fig. 3d](#page-7-0), which also shows a slightly larger grey value (higher X-ray absorption) of 23,500 a. u. compared with the pristine LZP-NCM particles (the topmost panel of [Fig. 3d](#page-7-0)). Further analysis of the other three depthdependent horizontal rectangular ROIs along the cathode, as shown in [Fig. 3f](#page-7-0)–h, suggests a similar finding of the LZP-NCM particles, that is, the further away from the Al current collector, the lower Li content the particle possesses. In the meantime, a careful examination of the grey values of four rectangular ROIs near the Li/ LPSCl interface (black dash rectangles named E-1 to E-4 in [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0)), which is shown in [Fig. 3e](#page-7-0), shows that their grey values have not changed significantly compared with the pristine state (the topmost panel in [Fig. 3e](#page-7-0)), indicating little or no taking in of low Xray absorbing materials. Comparing these results with those obtained from the cycled NCM|Li-100 cell, one can note that although both cathode particles have experienced varying degrees of delithiation, yet no LZP-NCM particles are found drifting in the SE of the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell and they also possess comparatively more Li content after battery cycling.

A fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results suggests that by homogenizing the electrochemical activity of NCM particles via LZP coating, the heterogeneous degree of Li stripping at Li anode and the likelihood of Li plating at the SE intergranular boundaries could be notably mitigated. This comparative study validates clearly a codependent correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li ion flux.\n",

      "Postmortem characterizations of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell provide further and complementary information to the codependent failure mechanisms. Firstly, the cross-sectional SEM images of the cycled NCM and LZP-NCM particles collected respectively from these two tomo-cells are vividly shown in Fig. S9a (online). From this figure, one can obviously note a serious physical contact failure between NCM particles and SE (white filling area in the left upper panel) as well as noticeable internal cracks (white arrows in the right upper panel). In contrast, no obvious detachment between LZP-NCM and SE as well as cracks (the lower panels of Fig. S9a online) is observed in cycled LZP-NCM particles. Only isolated honeycomb pore structures are detected (the lower right panel). Postmortem cross-sectional SEM characterizations of the cycled NCM and LZP-NCM particles collected from the cycled swage-cells, which are shown in Fig. S9b and Note S3 (online), display a consistent finding. Besides, XRD measurement was conducted to study the compositional changes at the cathode in these two tomo-cells.

      "XRD patterns and Fig. 4a and b show the XPS results. The XRD results show that, besides the major diffraction peaks from SS, Li, and LPSCl, a variety of other diffraction peaks (yellow dash rectangles in Fig. S11 online) assigned to newly generated parasitic products are noted from the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell compared with the LZP-NMC|Li-100 tomo-cell. To further obtain the constituent information of these parasitic products, the depth-dependent XPS analysis of S 2p and Li 1s after different etching depths (20, 40, 80, and 160 nm) was carried out, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. From the results of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, as shown in Fig. 4a, one can note clearly from the Li 1s spectrum that the major parasitic products are Li2Sx (at 56.3 eV, green shadows). Additionally, the existence of an S 2p doublet at 162 and 163 eV from its S 2p spectrum also confirms the formation of Li2Sx and P2Sy species (green shadow). It is worth noting that with continuous etching, the content of Li2Sx, together with those of Li2S (at 54.7 eV), LPSCl (at 55.5 eV) and Li0 anode (at 53.9 eV) gradually decrease but do not vanish. This result suggests that a thick layer of parasitic products is formed at the Li/SE interface in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. Looking at the XPS results of the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, which are shown in Fig. 4b, only a small number of parasitic products (green shadow) are observed. This is indicative of a relatively lower extent of side reactions at Li/SE interface in the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell compared with that in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. These experimental findings provide further evidence that a heterogeneous electrochemical reaction at the cathode side could cause an increased local current density that accelerates unwanted side-reactions at the anode side.\n",

      "Finite element analysis was further conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in ASSLMBs. The model cell is consisted of a ''sandwich\" structure containing Li anode (upper grey), SE electrolyte (middle part), and the cathode (five rows of circular cathode particles dispersed evenly in SE electrolyte at the bottom), as shown in Fig. S12 (online). Two different scenarios regarding the Li anode were simulated. Firstly, the effect of cathode reaction heterogeneity on the uneven lithium deposition behavior was simulated using a flat Li anode mimicking the SXCT results of the uncycled cells (Fig. S12a online). As shown in Fig. S13, Movie S1, S2, and Note S4 (online), the distribution of (in)active cathode regions directly affects the uniformity of Li plating at the opposite anode, with preferential Li plating occurring facing the active cathode regions. <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>Moreover, the nonuniformity of Li plating is exacerbated with the increase of deposition time and current density. This result suggests that the inhomogeneous electrochemical reaction at cathode side dominates the inhomogeneous Li depositing at anode side even though the Li anode is originally flat with no defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the second scenario-the Li anode is modified with protruded elliptical Li deposits extending into the SE-mimicking the SXCT results of the decayed NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, as shown in Fig. S12b (online), was simulated. The simulation was conducted during battery charging at 100 A/m2 and the results are shown in [Fig. 4](#page-8-0)c–f. From the simulation result of the potential distribution shown in [Fig. 4c](#page-8-0), one can note that the largest potential drop occurs between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region, compared with the other regions of the battery components. This localized potential drop could generate a heterogeneous distribution of the electric field, the maximum of which would also occur between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region. Consequently, this would cause the Li+ ion flux density to be the maximum between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region, as confirmed by the current density distribution simulation shown in [Fig. 4](#page-8-0)d. This concentrated Li+ ion flux suggests that most of the Li+ ion flux released from the active cathode particles would be plated preferentially at the protruded elliptical Li deposit regions. The continuous plating of Li at these regions could in turn induce mechanical stresses that subject to their neighboring SE. As exhibited from the von Mises stress distribution diagram in [Fig. 4e](#page-8-0) and the zoomed-in view in [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0), one can obviously note that the stress is concentrated mainly in the electrolyte contacting the protruded elliptical Li deposits, especially the part facing the cathode region (orange arrows in [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0) online). Besides, [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0) shows that the maximum stress reaches almost 6–10 GPa (orange arrow), which is higher than the critical yield strength of SE (5 GPa) [\\[38–](#page-11-0) [40\\].](#page-11-0) Additionally, this maximum stress may also exceed the critical stress required to propagate the crack according to its fracture toughness (K = 0.25 MPa m1 2) with Pc ¼ K fðdv;aÞ ffiffiffiffi pa p (Pc 40 MPa) [\\[41–43\\]](#page-11-0).

      "These finite element analysis results evidence obviously that the heterogenous reactions occurring at cathode can cause ununiform Li plating at anode, which has been seldom reported in previous work. The initial reaction heterogeneity at cathode seems to be the fundamental cause and the uneven Li+ ion flux, which transports charges between cathode and anode, seems to be the ''mediator\". Thus, the two electrodes are interdependent during battery operation. Furthermore, this analysis implies that the Li plating induced mechanical stress could cause not only the irreversible plastic deformation of SE, but also the crack formation and propagation within SE that accommodates further Li deposition. These simulation results, which provide fundamental insights towards the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in solid-state batteries, are in good agreement with the SXCT results.\n",

The first column displays the pristine states of these two different types of batteries.

This homogenous electrochemical reaction at the cathode would result in an even and steady Li+ ion flux flowing into/from the Li anode, leading to a balanced and uniform Li plating/stripping. This is schematically shown in the second column of Fig. 5. During the later cycles of the batteries using bare NCM particles, the accumulation of continuous volumetric expansion/contraction of these particles would exacerbate, causing their structural disintegration and physical detachment/isolation from the cathode matrix.

As a consequence, both the extent of the Li stripping from the Li anode facing the active NCM particles and the likelihood of Li plating into the SE intergranular boundaries located between them would become higher. As a result, irreversible depletion of Li anode and deformation of SE would occur, as illustrated in the third upper panel in [Fig. 5.](#page-9-0) In contrast, owning to the mechanically strong and electrochemically stable LZP coating, the LZP-NCM particles would maintain their homogeneous reaction.

      "The revealed codependent failure mechanisms between cathode and anode shed new insights into the fundamental science underpinning the decaying problems of solid-state batteries and may help to contribute to their further development in the following aspects. In the first place, probing the degradation mechanisms of cathode and anode together with their coupling in fullcell configurations instead of studying them separately or individually in half-cell or symmetrical-cell configurations may provide more realistic and reliable knowledge of the failure reasons in solid-state batteries. Until now, significant progress has been made in understanding the degradation mechanisms of cathode and anode in half- or symmetrical-cells, but much fewer works have sought to understand the coupled and interdependent relationship between these two electrodes in full-cells. The current discovery of a codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode that is mediated by uneven Li+ ion flux suggests that moving to full cells may provide unexpected and novel knowledge explaining the overall cell performance decay. Secondly, directly studying the microstructural and physicochemical evolution of the battery components as a function of battery performance is highly desirable. For instance, significant efforts have been devoted to understand the mechanisms by which Li electrodeposits propagate through the SE when plating above CCD. However, a single CCD test cannot fully capture the dynamic change occurring within the battery and a recent study suggests that unstable Li plating and short circuiting of the battery occur readily at rates much lower than the measured CCD when a sufficient areal capacity is passed [\\[46\\].](#page-11-0) The SXCT results demonstrate unambiguously that the local current density flowing within the battery, which is solely carried by the active material particles, may be overwhelmingly larger than the averaged current density, which is measured by a battery cycler. The current research emphasizes the importance of studying the synchronizing microstructural changes of battery components during battery operation. Last but not least, the current study highlights the unneglectable significance of the mechanical properties of the solid electrolyte. It is now widely acknowledged that during a solid-state battery operation, not only the electrochemical reaction of the electrodes constantly is evolving, but the (electro) chemically induced mechanical stresses are also continuously changing. Mechanistic understandings of the mechanical properties of Li anode [\\[47\\]](#page-11-0) and cathode [\\[11,48\\]](#page-11-0) have shown significant advances in recent years, but the related knowledge of solid electrolyte is still underdeveloped [\\[3,39\\].](#page-11-0) A recent study from Sheldon et al. [\\[49\\]](#page-11-0) reported a rate-dependent viscoplasticity deformation of sulfide SE and they suggested that although the low yield stress of sulfide SE might raise additional concerns when it comes to suppress interfacial roughening, yet this viscoplasticity property is amenable to strategies for mitigating Li electrodeposit propagation. Nevertheless, the SXCT results demonstrate clearly that this non-recoverable viscoplasticity deformation of SE may bring irreversible and unwanted structural changes to both itself and Li anode, deteriorating tremendously the overall structural integrity and reliability of the battery components.\n",

      "In this study, we used the synchrotron X-ray computed tomography, together with postmortem characterizations and finite element simulations, to explore the underlying degradation mechanisms of all solid-state Li metal batteries built with NCM cathode active material, LPSCl solid electrolyte, and Li metal anode. In addition, LZP-NCM was used as control samples during the study. A comparison of the SXCT results of three tomo-cells, which are NCM|Li-0 (after 0 cycle), NCM|Li-50 (after 50 cycles), and NCM| Li-100 (after 100 cycles), shows a slight change in the NCM|Li-50 cell after intermediate capacity decay and a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell after severe capacity decay. Further in-depth analysis of both the cathode and the anode via analyzing their greyscale value changes from the NCM|Li-100 cell points out a codependent failure mechanism between them, that is mediated by uneven Li+ ion flux. In contrast, the SXCT results of another three tomo-cells, which are LZP-NCM|Li-0 (after 0 cycle), LZP-NCM|Li-50 (after 50 cycles), and LZP-NCM|Li-100 (after 100 cycles), demonstrate a slight change in the LZP-NCM|Li-50 cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell, both of which display improved capacity retention and decreased capacity decay. This fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results from the NCM and LZP-NCM based batteries validates a codependent failure correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li+ ion flux. Apart from the SXCT results, postmortem SEM, XRD and depth-dependent XPS characterizations of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell provide further and complementary information to the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode. In the last, finite element analysis has been conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode materials in ASSLMBs. The revealed codependent failure behavior between cathode and anode provides a holistic mechanistic understanding of the sophisticated and elusive failure mechanisms of all solid-state batteries, and opens new opportunities for developing novel strategies to counteract them for future research.\n",

Besides, McDowell's group [\\[13\\]](#page-11-0) confirmed that the unwanted Li/SE side reactions are current-dependent in nature and the generated by-products determine dominantly the interfacial chemo-mechanical failures.

These studies have greatly enriched the knowledge of ASSLMB degradation mechanisms at the cathode, anode and SE sides from the aspects of chemistry, electrochemistry, and mechanology. However, considering that most of the abovementioned studies employ half-cell configurations and focus primarily on single electrode component, uncertainties would arise when applying these conclusions during full-cell batteries optimization. Additionally, although each battery component contributes to the detected performance decay, it is very likely that they play varying roles during the operation and it is still unclear whether one or combination of them dominates. Moreover, taking into account that the battery performance decays inconsistently during different stages of operation, it appears that the failure mechanism may evolve constantly during battery cycling and an interdependent interaction among the abovementioned failure mechanisms may exist. Therefore, developing a holistic mechanistic understanding of these failure behaviors contributed from cathode, anode, and SEs is indispensable in drawing a complete picture describing the comprehensive degradation mechanisms of ASSLMBs. Unfortunately, this comprehensive and elaborate understanding remains unestablished due to the lack of proper characterization techniques.\n",

      "Synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (SXCT) seems to be one of the most suitable characterization techniques due to its versatile benefits, including non-destructive and three-dimensional nature, multi-scale spatial resolution, and high temporal resolution [\\[18,19\\].](#page-11-0) Its underlying principle is based on the physics of interaction of X-rays with matter, which can be described using the Beer-Lambert's law [\\[20\\].](#page-11-0) The attenuation degree of the transmitted Xrays, which is manifested as different greyscale values in tomographic images, is proportionally correlated with the electron density of the constituent atoms [\\[21\\].](#page-11-0) Hence, different battery components among AMs, SEs, and Li can be distinguished by analyzing grey values of the obtained absorption-contrast images. Using this technique, Sun's group [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0) visualized the microstructural evolution of AM particles in solid-state batteries and disclosed the origin of low reversible capacity caused by the poor physical contact during their heterogeneous phase conversion. In addition, McDowell's group [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0) found that it is the extent of the mechanical fracture in the SE other than the electrochemically formed interphase layer that causes the impedance increase. Recently, both Shearing's group [\\[24\\]](#page-11-0) and Bruce's group [\\[25\\]](#page-11-0) have three-dimensionally tracked the propagation of SE cracks and the ensuing infiltration of Li electrodeposits therein in Li symmetrical cells. Our group [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) has also visually and three-dimensionally recorded the irreversible Li creep, the evolved Li/SE interface, as well as the plastic deformation and mechanical fracture of SE after battery cycling, revealing the complicated electro-chemomechanical coupling in Li symmetrical cells. These applications of SXCT in solid-state battery research provide unparalleled opportunities in exploring the microstructure evolution of the battery components during battery operation and shed unprecedent insights into the fundamental degradation mechanisms determining battery failure. However, report using this technique to establish a holistic mechanistic understanding of the sophisticated and elusive failure mechanisms in full-cell type ASSLMBs is still missing.\n",

      "Herein, we chose LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM)|Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl)|Li ASSLMB as a model cell and SXCT as the main probing tool to investigate the underpinning performance deterioration mechanisms of ASSLMBs. A comparison of the SXCT results between the uncycled and decayed ASSLMBs clearly points to a codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode material that is mediated by uneven Li ion flux. To be more specific, the SXCT results suggest that the gradually accumulated volumetric expansion/contraction of NCM particles could cause detachment and isolation from the cathode matrix, leading to partial deactivation of cathode and localized current density on the remaining active region. Consequently, both the extent of Li stripping and the probability of Li+ ion reduction at the SE intergranular boundaries facing the remained active NCM particles become higher, leading to further loss of active cathode and anode materials as well as an exacerbated capacity decay. Further electrochemical tests and SXCT results clearly show that by homogenizing the electrochemical reactions at the cathode side via LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) coating (LZP-NCM), both the homogeneity of Li stripping/plating at the anode side and the capacity retention of the ASSLMBs are improved. This fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results from the NCM and LZP-NCM based batteries validates the codependent failure correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li ion flux. Moreover, postmortem experimental findings provide further evidence that a heterogeneous electrochemical reaction at the cathode side could cause an increased local current density to exacerbate unwanted side-reactions at the anode side. In the last, finite element analysis provides direct insights of the heterogeneous potential distribution and current focusing between cathode and anode in the decayed ASSLMBs. Our work emphasizes the previously underestimated interdependence between cathode and anode in governing ASSLMB failures and the discovered codependent failure mechanism contributes significantly to a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanisms in ASSLMBs.\n",

The LZP coating onto NCM was achieved via a facile sol–gel method. During the LZP buffer layer coating, a corresponding mole ratio of LiH2PO4 and Zr(NO3)45H2O was mixed in ethanol solution for 2 h to prepare the LZP sol precursor. After that, NCM powders were added into the LZP sol precursor at 80 C and they were mixed under slow agitation for 6 h for coating. In the current study, the 1 wt% LZP coating was chosen, and the mass ratio of the NCM cathode material and the LZP coating material is 1:0.01. The coating process was finished when the ethanol was completely volatilized. In the last, the obtained product was sintered at 750 C under oxygen atmosphere for 1 h to obtain the final LZP coated NCM811, i.e., the LZP-NCM.\n",

The steps for the allsolid-state battery assembly are as follows: firstly, 120 mg LPSCl solid-state electrolyte powder was added to the battery mold, which was then pressed into a solid pellet at 150 MPa pressure for 2 min. Secondly, 10 mg composite cathode powder was evenly tiled on one side of the solid-state electrolyte pellet under 370 MPa for 2 min. Thirdly, a lithium foil (d = 8 mm) with a thickness of 0.3 mm was placed on the other side of the solid-state electrolyte pellet at 150 MPa for 1 min.

Then, 50 mg LPSCl electrolyte powder was added in the polyimide tube (with a diameter of 3 mm). The 4 mg cathode composite powder was evenly tiled on top of the solid-state electrolyte layer, followed by the Al sheet (with a diameter of 3 mm) as a current collector. Note that the cathode composite for building tomo-cells is the same as that for building swage-cells. Afterwards, 100 MPa pressure was applied to them for 1 min to form a pellet. After releasing the pressure, the obtained pellet was sandwiched by two stainless-steel screws during cell assembly. All tomo-cells were properly sealed off before taking out of the glovebox. Tomo-cells assembled with NCM and LZP-NCM were cycled at 0.1 C between 2.6 and 4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+ ) for 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. All cells were cycled at 30 C without applying additional constant pressure. The torque that was used to fasten both the top and bottom bolts was 2 N m (measured by a digital torque wrench) and no further external pressure was used during battery operation. The electrochemical results of tomo-(swage-)cells show that the swage-cells are more prone to undergo short circuit than the tomo-cells, which is probably due to the grown lithium dendrite that can puncture easily the thin SE electrolyte in the swage-cells.\n",

      "Part of the synchrotron X-ray tomography measurements were conducted at P05 beamline at DESY (Hamburg, Germany). For the measurements conducted here, the synchrotron beam energy was monochromatized to 25 keV using a double crystal monochromator (DCM). A CdWO4 single crystal scintillator of 100 lm thickness was used to convert the X-ray to visible light. A fast KIT CMOS camera (5120 pixel 3840 pixel) that was kept out of the direct beam using a mirror was used. The 2400 projections within a 180 battery rotation were recorded with exposure times of 25 ms per projection. The field of view (FoV) is 3.28 mm 2.46 mm, with a pixel size of 0.65 lm. Note that a binning process of 2 by 2 was used when reconstructing the dataset to get a high signal to noise ratio, yielding a final pixel size of 1.3 lm. The tomography data from P05 beamline were reconstructed at the beamline using the Matlab program based on the ASTRA Toolbox [\\[29\\]](#page-11-0). To improve the data consistency of the grey values calculated from the selected regions of interests (ROIs) from different regions, the analysis of the greyscale values of the reconstructed volumes of the cycled tomo-cells was normalized using the greyscale values belonging to the LPSCl electrolyte.\n",

      "Besides the SXCT measurements conducted at the P05 beamline, an uncycled tomo-cell was also measured at the BL13HB beamline (the previous BL13W1 beamline) at SSRF (Shanghai, China). For the measurement conducted at SSRF, the synchrotron beam energy was monochromatized via a double crystal monochromator to 20 keV. The detector system comprised a 50 lm thick Yag:Ce scintillator and four kinds of X-ray critical current density (CCD) detectors of different spatial resolutions from 0:19 lm/pixel to 24 lm/pixel. During the measurement, 2000 projections within a 180 battery rotation were recorded with the exposure time of 80 ms. The FoV is 3.328 mm 3.328 mm. The resultant spatial resolution is 1.625 lm. The sample-to-detector distance was 40 mm. Under this measuring condition, the inline phase-contrast effect could occur to some extent and the samples were measured under mixed absorption- and phase-contrast mode. The reconstructed data are shown in Fig. S1 (online), which are in good agreement with the results obtained at the P05 beamline. Hence, only the measurements conducted at the P05 beamline are shown in the main text.\n",

      "Finite element method was conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in ASSLMBs. The model of the simulation battery is shown in Fig. S12 (online). It is consisted of a ''sandwich\" structure containing rectangular Li anode (upper grey part), SE electrolyte (middle part), and the cathode (five rows of circular cathode particles (10 lm in diameter) dispersed evenly in SE electrolyte at the bottom). The dimension of the simulation battery is 420 lm 250 lm (length width). The thickness of the solid-state electrolyte is 100 lm. To save the simulation cost and focus on the codependent behavior between cathode and anode, the polycrystalline structure of NCM particles and the stress evolution in them during battery cycling are not considered. Two different scenarios regarding the Li anode were simulated. Firstly, the effect of cathode reaction heterogeneity on the uneven lithium deposition behavior was simulated using a flat Li anode mimicking the SXCT results of the uncycled cells. During the simulation of this scenario, the cathode particles located in the central part of the cathode are artificially set to be electrochemically inactive to study their effect on the Li deposition behavior at Li anode side (Fig. S12a online). The results of Li plating accumulation are shown in Fig. S13 (online). Secondly, the scenario in which the Li anode was modified with protruded elliptical Li deposits extending into the SE (Fig. S12b online), mimicking the SXCT results of the decayed NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, was simulated. During the simulation of this scenario, the cathode particles located at both sides were artificially set to be electrochemically inactive to simulate their physical contact failure during battery cycling. The simulation was conducted during battery charging at 100 A/m2 current density. The potential distribution, Li+ ion flux density distribution and von Mises stress distribution in the simulation battery were simulated. During both simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density of LPSCl-based electrolyte are 28 GPa, 0.27, and 1.8 g/cm3 , respectively.

[Fig. 1](#page-4-0)a shows the schematic illustration of the as-studied ASSLMBs using both swage-cell and tomo-cell designs. The cycling performance test of ASSLMBs using the swage-cell design, as shown in [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)b, shows that although both the studied cells (assembled with either NCM or LZP-NCM) decay during cycling, the capacity retention of the NCM|LPSCl|Li battery after 70 cycles (abbreviated as NCM|Li-70, 66.1%, red dot line) is lower than that of the LZP-NCM|LPSCl|Li cell after 90 cycles (abbreviated as LZP-NCM|Li-90, 79%, blue dot line). [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)c shows respectively the selected charge–discharge profiles of the NCM|Li-70 swage-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-90 swage-cell, displaying more severe decay of the former. These results suggest that the swagecell using bare NCM exhibits the lower capacity retention and faster capacity decay compared with the control cell using LZP-NCM, which is in good agreement with previous report [\\[27\\]](#page-11-0). In a similar way, the results shown in [Fig. 1](#page-4-0)d and e exhibit that a consistent electrochemical evolution to the swage-cells can be noted from the tomo-cells, that is, besides a continuous capacity decline, a lower capacity retention and faster capacity decay is observed in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell than the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. Note that the obtained lower capacities of the tomo-cells compared with the swage-cells are caused by the lack of an external auxiliary pressure (0 MPa for tomo-cells vs. 160 MPa for swagecells). Despite this difference, these results suggest that the tomo-cell design could be used reliably for studying the gradual degradation mechanisms of ASSLMBs. Hence, the tomo-cell design, which is compatible with the non-destructive SXCT technique, was used to reveal the fundamental science for the continuous capacity loss of the batteries built with bare NCM on one hand, and on the other hand unravel the underlying cause for the enhanced performance of the batteries built with LZP-NCM.\n",

These digital greyscale images possessing distinct absorption contrast are correlated with the different Xray absorbing capabilities of the constituting atoms in the measured sample, with bright (dark) region corresponding to high(low) atomic number atom contained NCM (S or Li). The three panels in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a collectively exhibit a slight change at the Li/LPSCl interface in the NCM|Li-50 cell (pink dotted line in panel II) after intermediate capacity decay but a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell (pink dotted line in panel III) after severe capacity decay, compared with the NCM|Li-0 tomo-cell (pink dotted line in panel I). The panel III in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a further shows that besides the overall diminished thickness of Li anode, at some regions of the Li/LPSCl interface, the Li anode has completely ''disappeared\" and the electrolyte is found to reach almost the SS collector (yellow arrows in panel III). These three panels in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a also demonstrate a similar morphological change at the cathode side: a slight change in the NCM|Li-50 cell vs. a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell (blue dotted lines). The panel III in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)a further shows that the NCM particles that are in close contact with the LPSCl electrolyte are somehow ''diluted\" by the LPSCl electrolyte after 100 cycles, as indicated by the ''drifted\" NCM particles (blue arrows in panel III). The significant changes of the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell are three-dimensionally shown and compared with the NCM|Li-0 cell, as shown in their 3D volume renderings [(Fig. 2](#page-5-0)b).

      "Further in-depth investigation of the microstructural changes in the decayed NCM|Li-100 cell comparing with the pristine NCM|Li-0 cell is conducted via analyzing their greyscale value changes. During the analysis of the greyscale values, several 2D ROIs (the interesting regions to be analyzed), which can capture reliably the characteristic changes of battery components (e.g., cathode and electrolyte), are carefully selected and analyzed. To begin with, four rectangular ROIs are selected from the four green dash rectangles (region i' to iv') in the control NCM|Li-0 cell (the first panel in [Fig. 2b](#page-5-0)) and they are enlarged as the in-set figures in Fig. S5a (online). A visual inspection of these enlarged figures demonstrates a homogenous distribution of NCM particles through the cathode. This is confirmed in Fig. S5b (online) by their consistent histograms of the distribution of grey values (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows to show more details), with one major peak around 22,100 arbitrary unit (a.u.) assigned to the LPSCl SE and one shoulder peak around 22,600 a.u. corresponding to the NCM particles. This homogeneous distribution of the NCM particles through the cathode is also proved by analyzing three depth-depended square ROIs selected from three horizontal panels at three different depths along the cathode, as shown in Fig. S5c and d (online). In contrast, the different scenario is captured in the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell (the second panel in [Fig. 2b](#page-5-0)), as clearly shown in the in-set figures of black rectangles in [Fig. 2c](#page-5-0): slightly brighter (higher X-ray absorbing) NCM particles are drifted above the slightly blurred (comparatively lower X-ray absorbing) NCM particles located near the Al current collector. Their histogram profiles of grey values (with log-scaled version superimposed in color shadows) shown in [Fig. 2d](#page-5-0) exhibit two different features compared with the control pristine sample: (1) the overall grey values corresponding to the NCM particles become higher than the original 22,600 a.u. (red dash line in the topmost panel), which exceed 23,000 a.u.; and (2) the NCM shoulder peak is significantly broadened and in some area like region C-3, the highest grey value corresponding to the strongest X-ray absorption reaches 25,000 a.u (red dash line in the panel C-3). Further analysis of another three rectangular ROIs selected from three different depth-dependent horizontal semicircular planes along the cathode, as shown in [Fig. 2f](#page-5-0)–h, yields similar findings. These results suggest that the drifted particles at the cathode/SE interface [(Fig. 2,](#page-5-0) g1) do possess higher grey value (25,000 a.u., light blue dash line in [Fig. 2h](#page-5-0)) than the particles located near the Al current collector ([Fig. 2,](#page-5-0) g3, dark blue dash line in [Fig. 2h](#page-5-0)).\n",

      "These unraveled microstructural changes of the cycled cathode can partially explain the capacity decay of the NCM|Li-100 cell. First of all, the currently observed drifted NCM particles in the SE should be generated from the push up by the remaining NCM particles via their significant volumetric expansion during battery cycling. Considering that these drifted NCM particles possess stronger X-ray absorbing capability (25,000 a.u.) than their pristine state (22,600 a.u.), it appears that they are at the delithiated state of low content of low X-ray absorbing Li. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that these drifted NCM particles are very likely electrochemically inactive and they are ionically or electronically isolated from the cathode matrix. As a matter of fact, Carter's group [\\[32\\]](#page-11-0) found that delamination of active material from the composite electrode can be triggered when the volumetric change of the electrode particles reaches about 7.5% during (de)intercalation, which is the case for the currently used NCM-811 that undergoes about 7% volume change during operation [\\[11\\].](#page-11-0) These deactivated NCM particles would result in the loss of battery capacity during cycling. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that although the blurred NCM particles near the Al collector appear to have decreased X-ray absorbing capability, grey value analysis suggests that they actually possess higher X-ray absorbing ability (c.a., 24,200 a.u.) than their pristine state (22,600 a.u.). This fact implies that most of the blurred NCM particles are also at the delithiated state of low content of low X-ray absorbing Li. The ''blurring\" of these NCM particles is most likely resulted from the formation of non-X-ray absorbing cracks, as shown below in the post-mortem SEM results. Collectively, these results show that the deactivation of the NCM particles and the loss of Li content in them are responsible for the capacity decay and the lost Li should be repositioned in other battery components such as the SE and anode (see more discussion below).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the anode side, looking at the overall diminished thickness of Li anode and the regions of disappeared Li as vividly shown in Fig. 2a, it is interesting to ask why the Li anode is diminished and the LPSCl electrolyte is seemingly swelled after long-term battery cycling. Aiming to study if the ''disappeared\" Li has ''migrated\" into the LPSCl SE and caused its swell during battery cycling, the greyscale histogram profiles of the selected four rectangular ROIs near anode side (regions E-1 to E-4 in black dash rectangles in [Fig. 2](#page-5-0)c) are analyzed and shown in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0) (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows). This figure shows that, compared with the pristine sample (the topmost panel in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0)), the LPSCl peaks become broader with low grey values extending to 20,000 a.u. (black arrows in [Fig. 2e](#page-5-0)). The extension of grey values of the cycled LPSCl SE (e.g., region E-2 to E-4 in [Fig. 2c](#page-5-0)) to lower numbers indicates that it is taking in of low X-ray absorbing materials such as generated Li electrodeposits or formed cracks. In order to further confirm and discern this indication, two rectangular ROIs that are selected respectively from two cross-sections of the intermediately decayed NCM|Li-50 cell and the severely decayed NCM|Li-100 cell are investigated, as shown in Fig. S6 (online). Fig. S6a1 (online) shows that the selected cross-section of the NCM|Li-50 cell and therefrom a rectangular ROI of a red box is cropped and enlarged in Fig. S6a2 (online). The plot profile of the greyscale value along the red arrow line in Fig. S6a2 (online) is shown in Fig. S6a3 (online), which shows clearly the existence and embracing of Li by the surrounding electrolyte. Moreover, from the cross-section and the selected ROI of the NCM|Li-100 cell, as shown respectively in Fig. S6b1 and b2 (online), one can observe notably that a long and narrow Li ''chip\", which looks like being squeezed into the space between neighboring LPSCl grains, is completely enclosed within the LPSCl SE. This is confirmed by the plot profile of the greyscale value along the red arrow line (Fig. S6b2 online), transecting the Li chip and the surrounding LPSCl SE, as shown in Fig. S6b3 (online). This isolated Li deposition within the intergranular boundaries has been theoretically explained from an electronic conductivity perspective and then experimentally confirmed [\\[33–35\\].](#page-11-0) Additionally, previous report from Pylypenko's group [\\[36\\]](#page-11-0) also attributed the gradually diminished thickness of Li anode as a function of battery cycling to its migration into the porous structures of the b-Li3PS4 (LPS) SE. The current finding of the Li deposition within specific SE regions can perfectly explain the loss of Li content at NCM cathode as well as the diminished Li bulk at Li anode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining the abovementioned results and discussions at cathode and anode sides, a clear and holistic view of the failure mechanisms of the solid-state batteries can be reliably obtained. During the former cycles, almost all NCM particles participate in electrochemical reactions due to the continuous, homogeneous and percolating ion and electron conduction network, guaranteed by the sufficient solid–solid contact shown in Fig. S7 (online). This homogenous electrochemical reaction at the cathode would result in an even and steady Li+ ion flux flowing into/from the Li anode, leading to a balanced and uniform Li plating/stripping. With continuous cycling, the gradually accumulated volumetric expansion/ contraction of cathode particles would take effect, pushing up the outlying particles into discretely drifted ones on one hand, and on the other hand isolating some particles from the cathode matrix. These two scenarios would both lead inevitably to capacity decay due to the deactivation of the NCM particles. The deactivation of NCM particles also implies that during subsequent cycling, the overall cell current that is either provided by or subjected to the cell would concentrate mostly on the remaining active NCM particles. This current focusing (or constriction) is twofold [\\[37\\]:](#page-11-0) one is the uneven Li+ ion flux that causes significant Li stripping from the part of Li anode facing the active NCM particles during battery discharging, the other one is the increased localized current density that drives the Li+ ion flux into the SE intergranular boundaries where they are preferentially reduced during battery charging. This hypothesis explains fundamentally the phenomena of the ''disappeared\" Li anode and the ''swelled\" LPSCl SE. This irreversible consumption of the anode Li would aggravate due to the further loss of active NCM particles, and in the end, the battery would completely fail due to the entire depletion of the accessible Li.\n",

These three panels collectively exhibit that, compared with the LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell, no appreciable changes at the Li/ LPSCl interface are observed in both the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-50 cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell (pink dotted lines) besides a homogeneously decreased thickness of Li anode (pink double-headed arrows). [Fig. 3b](#page-7-0) shows comparatively the 3D volume renderings of the LZP-NMC|Li-0 and LZP-NMC|Li-100 cells. In a similar way to the analysis of the aforementioned NCM|Li cell, an in-depth investigation of the microstructural changes in the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell comparing the pristine LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell is conducted via analyzing their greyscale value changes. Fig. S8a (online) shows the results of the selected cross-sections of the reference LZP-NCM|Li-0 cell and the four black rectangular ROIs containing cathode. These ROIs show a homogenous distribution of the LZP-NCM particles through the cathode, which is confirmed in Fig. S8b (online) by their consistent grey value histograms around 22,300 a.u. (with log-scaled version overlaid in color shadows). The homogeneous distribution of the LZP-NCM particles through the cathode is also proved by analyzing three depthdependent horizontal square ROIs along the cathode, as shown in Fig. S8c and d (online). It is worth noting that the X-ray absorption of LZP-NCM particles decreases slightly compared with NCM particles, due to either the wrapping of LZP containing light elements (e.g., Li and P) or the X-ray refraction at the interface. For the cathode cycled in the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell, [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0) shows the selected four cross-sectional panels (region i–iv in the right panel of [Fig. 3](#page-7-0)b) as well as the enlarged view of the four rectangular ROIs containing cathode (black rectangles in [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0)). A visual inspection of these ROIs shows that slightly brighter (higher X-ray absorbing) LZP-NCM particles are located uppermost while slightly blurred (comparatively lower X-ray absorbing) LZP-NCM particles are positioned at the bottom near the Al collector. This varied delithiation state of the cycled LZP-NCM particles is confirmed by their histogram profiles of grey values (with log-scaled version superimposed in color shadows) shown in [Fig. 3d](#page-7-0), which also shows a slightly larger grey value (higher X-ray absorption) of 23,500 a. u. compared with the pristine LZP-NCM particles (the topmost panel of [Fig. 3d](#page-7-0)). Further analysis of the other three depthdependent horizontal rectangular ROIs along the cathode, as shown in [Fig. 3f](#page-7-0)–h, suggests a similar finding of the LZP-NCM particles, that is, the further away from the Al current collector, the lower Li content the particle possesses. In the meantime, a careful examination of the grey values of four rectangular ROIs near the Li/ LPSCl interface (black dash rectangles named E-1 to E-4 in [Fig. 3c](#page-7-0)), which is shown in [Fig. 3e](#page-7-0), shows that their grey values have not changed significantly compared with the pristine state (the topmost panel in [Fig. 3e](#page-7-0)), indicating little or no taking in of low Xray absorbing materials. Comparing these results with those obtained from the cycled NCM|Li-100 cell, one can note that although both cathode particles have experienced varying degrees of delithiation, yet no LZP-NCM particles are found drifting in the SE of the cycled LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell and they also possess comparatively more Li content after battery cycling.

A fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results suggests that by homogenizing the electrochemical activity of NCM particles via LZP coating, the heterogeneous degree of Li stripping at Li anode and the likelihood of Li plating at the SE intergranular boundaries could be notably mitigated. This comparative study validates clearly a codependent correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li ion flux.\n",

      "Postmortem characterizations of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell provide further and complementary information to the codependent failure mechanisms. Firstly, the cross-sectional SEM images of the cycled NCM and LZP-NCM particles collected respectively from these two tomo-cells are vividly shown in Fig. S9a (online). From this figure, one can obviously note a serious physical contact failure between NCM particles and SE (white filling area in the left upper panel) as well as noticeable internal cracks (white arrows in the right upper panel). In contrast, no obvious detachment between LZP-NCM and SE as well as cracks (the lower panels of Fig. S9a online) is observed in cycled LZP-NCM particles. Only isolated honeycomb pore structures are detected (the lower right panel). Postmortem cross-sectional SEM characterizations of the cycled NCM and LZP-NCM particles collected from the cycled swage-cells, which are shown in Fig. S9b and Note S3 (online), display a consistent finding. Besides, XRD measurement was conducted to study the compositional changes at the cathode in these two tomo-cells. The XRD results in Fig. S10 (online) show that a variety of diffraction peaks (yellow dash rectangles in Fig. S10 online) assigned to newly generated parasitic products are noted from the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell compared with the LZP-NMC|Li-100 tomo-cell.\n",

      "XRD patterns and Fig. 4a and b show the XPS results. The XRD results show that, besides the major diffraction peaks from SS, Li, and LPSCl, a variety of other diffraction peaks (yellow dash rectangles in Fig. S11 online) assigned to newly generated parasitic products are noted from the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell compared with the LZP-NMC|Li-100 tomo-cell. To further obtain the constituent information of these parasitic products, the depth-dependent XPS analysis of S 2p and Li 1s after different etching depths (20, 40, 80, and 160 nm) was carried out, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. From the results of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, as shown in Fig. 4a, one can note clearly from the Li 1s spectrum that the major parasitic products are Li2Sx (at 56.3 eV, green shadows). Additionally, the existence of an S 2p doublet at 162 and 163 eV from its S 2p spectrum also confirms the formation of Li2Sx and P2Sy species (green shadow). It is worth noting that with continuous etching, the content of Li2Sx, together with those of Li2S (at 54.7 eV), LPSCl (at 55.5 eV) and Li0 anode (at 53.9 eV) gradually decrease but do not vanish. This result suggests that a thick layer of parasitic products is formed at the Li/SE interface in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. Looking at the XPS results of the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, which are shown in Fig. 4b, only a small number of parasitic products (green shadow) are observed. This is indicative of a relatively lower extent of side reactions at Li/SE interface in the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell compared with that in the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell. These experimental findings provide further evidence that a heterogeneous electrochemical reaction at the cathode side could cause an increased local current density that accelerates unwanted side-reactions at the anode side.\n",

      "Finite element analysis was further conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in ASSLMBs. The model cell is consisted of a ''sandwich\" structure containing Li anode (upper grey), SE electrolyte (middle part), and the cathode (five rows of circular cathode particles dispersed evenly in SE electrolyte at the bottom), as shown in Fig. S12 (online). Two different scenarios regarding the Li anode were simulated. Firstly, the effect of cathode reaction heterogeneity on the uneven lithium deposition behavior was simulated using a flat Li anode mimicking the SXCT results of the uncycled cells (Fig. S12a online). As shown in Fig. S13, Movie S1, S2, and Note S4 (online), the distribution of (in)active cathode regions directly affects the uniformity of Li plating at the opposite anode, with preferential Li plating occurring facing the active cathode regions. <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>Moreover, the nonuniformity of Li plating is exacerbated with the increase of deposition time and current density. This result suggests that the inhomogeneous electrochemical reaction at cathode side dominates the inhomogeneous Li depositing at anode side even though the Li anode is originally flat with no defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the second scenario-the Li anode is modified with protruded elliptical Li deposits extending into the SE-mimicking the SXCT results of the decayed NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell, as shown in Fig. S12b (online), was simulated. The simulation was conducted during battery charging at 100 A/m2 and the results are shown in [Fig. 4](#page-8-0)c–f. From the simulation result of the potential distribution shown in [Fig. 4c](#page-8-0), one can note that the largest potential drop occurs between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region, compared with the other regions of the battery components. This localized potential drop could generate a heterogeneous distribution of the electric field, the maximum of which would also occur between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region. Consequently, this would cause the Li+ ion flux density to be the maximum between the protruded elliptical Li deposits and the facing active cathode region, as confirmed by the current density distribution simulation shown in [Fig. 4](#page-8-0)d. This concentrated Li+ ion flux suggests that most of the Li+ ion flux released from the active cathode particles would be plated preferentially at the protruded elliptical Li deposit regions. The continuous plating of Li at these regions could in turn induce mechanical stresses that subject to their neighboring SE. As exhibited from the von Mises stress distribution diagram in [Fig. 4e](#page-8-0) and the zoomed-in view in [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0), one can obviously note that the stress is concentrated mainly in the electrolyte contacting the protruded elliptical Li deposits, especially the part facing the cathode region (orange arrows in [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0) online). Besides, [Fig. 4f](#page-8-0) shows that the maximum stress reaches almost 6–10 GPa (orange arrow), which is higher than the critical yield strength of SE (5 GPa) [\\[38–](#page-11-0) [40\\].](#page-11-0) Additionally, this maximum stress may also exceed the critical stress required to propagate the crack according to its fracture toughness (K = 0.25 MPa m1 2) with Pc ¼ K fðdv;aÞ ffiffiffiffi pa p (Pc 40 MPa) [\\[41–43\\]](#page-11-0). K is the fracture toughness of the SE, f(dv, a) is a geometric factor, dv is the void diameter and a is the crack length [\\[44,45\\].](#page-11-0)\n",

      "These finite element analysis results evidence obviously that the heterogenous reactions occurring at cathode can cause ununiform Li plating at anode, which has been seldom reported in previous work. The initial reaction heterogeneity at cathode seems to be the fundamental cause and the uneven Li+ ion flux, which transports charges between cathode and anode, seems to be the ''mediator\". Thus, the two electrodes are interdependent during battery operation. Furthermore, this analysis implies that the Li plating induced mechanical stress could cause not only the irreversible plastic deformation of SE, but also the crack formation and propagation within SE that accommodates further Li deposition. These simulation results, which provide fundamental insights towards the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode in solid-state batteries, are in good agreement with the SXCT results.\n",

      "On the basis of the experimental findings and the finite element simulations, a schematic illustration describing the codependent failure mechanisms of ASSLMBs is exhibited in Fig. 5. The first row depicts the microstructural evolution of the battery components at typical cycling states in NCM|Li batteries and the second row depicts the equivalent circumstances in LZP-NCM|Li batteries. The first column displays the pristine states of these two different types of batteries. During the former cycles of the batteries, either NCM particles or LZP-NCM particles could participate fully in electrochemical reactions due to the structural integrity of the cathode. This homogenous electrochemical reaction at the cathode would result in an even and steady Li+ ion flux flowing into/from the Li anode, leading to a balanced and uniform Li plating/stripping. This is schematically shown in the second column of Fig. 5. During the later cycles of the batteries using bare NCM particles, the accumulation of continuous volumetric expansion/contraction of these particles would exacerbate, causing their structural disintegration and physical detachment/isolation from the cathode matrix. This yields the electrochemically inactive particles that decrease the cell capacity. Meanwhile, the remained active NCM particles would\n",

As a consequence, both the extent of the Li stripping from the Li anode facing the active NCM particles and the likelihood of Li plating into the SE intergranular boundaries located between them would become higher. As a result, irreversible depletion of Li anode and deformation of SE would occur, as illustrated in the third upper panel in [Fig. 5.](#page-9-0) In contrast, owning to the mechanically strong and electrochemically stable LZP coating, the LZP-NCM particles would maintain their homogeneous reaction. This facilitates a uniform Li stripping and plating at the Li/SE interface, as displayed in the third lower panel in [Fig. 5.](#page-9-0)\n",

      "The revealed codependent failure mechanisms between cathode and anode shed new insights into the fundamental science underpinning the decaying problems of solid-state batteries and may help to contribute to their further development in the following aspects. In the first place, probing the degradation mechanisms of cathode and anode together with their coupling in fullcell configurations instead of studying them separately or individually in half-cell or symmetrical-cell configurations may provide more realistic and reliable knowledge of the failure reasons in solid-state batteries. Until now, significant progress has been made in understanding the degradation mechanisms of cathode and anode in half- or symmetrical-cells, but much fewer works have sought to understand the coupled and interdependent relationship between these two electrodes in full-cells. The current discovery of a codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode that is mediated by uneven Li+ ion flux suggests that moving to full cells may provide unexpected and novel knowledge explaining the overall cell performance decay. Secondly, directly studying the microstructural and physicochemical evolution of the battery components as a function of battery performance is highly desirable. For instance, significant efforts have been devoted to understand the mechanisms by which Li electrodeposits propagate through the SE when plating above CCD. However, a single CCD test cannot fully capture the dynamic change occurring within the battery and a recent study suggests that unstable Li plating and short circuiting of the battery occur readily at rates much lower than the measured CCD when a sufficient areal capacity is passed [\\[46\\].](#page-11-0) The SXCT results demonstrate unambiguously that the local current density flowing within the battery, which is solely carried by the active material particles, may be overwhelmingly larger than the averaged current density, which is measured by a battery cycler. The current research emphasizes the importance of studying the synchronizing microstructural changes of battery components during battery operation. Last but not least, the current study highlights the unneglectable significance of the mechanical properties of the solid electrolyte. It is now widely acknowledged that during a solid-state battery operation, not only the electrochemical reaction of the electrodes constantly is evolving, but the (electro) chemically induced mechanical stresses are also continuously changing. Mechanistic understandings of the mechanical properties of Li anode [\\[47\\]](#page-11-0) and cathode [\\[11,48\\]](#page-11-0) have shown significant advances in recent years, but the related knowledge of solid electrolyte is still underdeveloped [\\[3,39\\].](#page-11-0) A recent study from Sheldon et al. [\\[49\\]](#page-11-0) reported a rate-dependent viscoplasticity deformation of sulfide SE and they suggested that although the low yield stress of sulfide SE might raise additional concerns when it comes to suppress interfacial roughening, yet this viscoplasticity property is amenable to strategies for mitigating Li electrodeposit propagation. Nevertheless, the SXCT results demonstrate clearly that this non-recoverable viscoplasticity deformation of SE may bring irreversible and unwanted structural changes to both itself and Li anode, deteriorating tremendously the overall structural integrity and reliability of the battery components.\n",

      "In this study, we used the synchrotron X-ray computed tomography, together with postmortem characterizations and finite element simulations, to explore the underlying degradation mechanisms of all solid-state Li metal batteries built with NCM cathode active material, LPSCl solid electrolyte, and Li metal anode. In addition, LZP-NCM was used as control samples during the study. A comparison of the SXCT results of three tomo-cells, which are NCM|Li-0 (after 0 cycle), NCM|Li-50 (after 50 cycles), and NCM| Li-100 (after 100 cycles), shows a slight change in the NCM|Li-50 cell after intermediate capacity decay and a significant one in the NCM|Li-100 cell after severe capacity decay. Further in-depth analysis of both the cathode and the anode via analyzing their greyscale value changes from the NCM|Li-100 cell points out a codependent failure mechanism between them, that is mediated by uneven Li+ ion flux. In contrast, the SXCT results of another three tomo-cells, which are LZP-NCM|Li-0 (after 0 cycle), LZP-NCM|Li-50 (after 50 cycles), and LZP-NCM|Li-100 (after 100 cycles), demonstrate a slight change in the LZP-NCM|Li-50 cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 cell, both of which display improved capacity retention and decreased capacity decay. This fair and equal comparison of the SXCT results from the NCM and LZP-NCM based batteries validates a codependent failure correlation between cathode and anode that is mediated by Li+ ion flux. Apart from the SXCT results, postmortem SEM, XRD and depth-dependent XPS characterizations of the NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell and the LZP-NCM|Li-100 tomo-cell provide further and complementary information to the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode. In the last, finite element analysis has been conducted to simulate and analyze the codependent failure mechanism between cathode and anode materials in ASSLMBs. The revealed codependent failure behavior between cathode and anode provides a holistic mechanistic understanding of the sophisticated and elusive failure mechanisms of all solid-state batteries, and opens new opportunities for developing novel strategies to counteract them for future research.\n",
