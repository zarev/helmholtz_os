      "###ANSWER: The porous interphase layer, formed between the separator and the anode during battery operation, contributes to performance decay by causing overvoltage increases. This layer likely hinders ion transport, leading to poor electrochemical performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "###QUESTION: How do the control experiments explain the evolution of Li/Na anodes?\n",
      "###ANSWER: Control experiments demonstrate that CO2 acts as a synergist, influencing the structural changes in Li and Na anodes. These insights reveal how operational conditions affect anode morphologies, impacting overall battery functionality.\n",

      "###QUESTION: What challenges persist with rechargeable alkali metal−CO2 batteries for practical use?\n",
      "###ANSWER: Despite their high theoretical energy density and CO2 fixation benefits, these batteries face performance limitations and durability issues, hindering real-world applications without further optimization of failure mechanisms.\n",

      "###QUESTION: How does overvoltage correlate with battery performance decay in alkali metal−CO2 systems?\n",

      "###QUESTION: What materials are analyzed to determine CO2 influence on Li/Na electrodes?\n",
      "###ANSWER: The evolution of both lithium and sodium electrodes is studied under CO2 exposure, revealing how CO2 synergistically affects material degradation and electrochemical behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "###QUESTION: How do operational conditions impact the formation of interphases in these batteries?\n",

      "###QUESTION: What theoretical advantages do alkali metal−CO2 batteries offer over traditional systems?\n",
      "###ANSWER: They provide high energy density and contribute to CO2 reduction, aligning with sustainable energy goals, though practical performance remains suboptimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "###QUESTION: How can the findings about interphase layers inform the design of next-generation Li/Na−CO2 batteries?\n",
